#Here's what we know: when the phone was first started the pin code code to log 
#in was 4096. Every time we enter the pin code, the number of times the pin code 
#has been entered correctly in the past is added to the value of the pin code, to get 
#the new pin. We know the system has been used 5520 times before. What will the pin code be this time?

#Tip: Get the right pin code to get the flag. All we know at the moment is that it's definitely eight digits long.

code = 4096
x=0
while x <= 5520:
    code = code + x
    x += 1
    print(code)
